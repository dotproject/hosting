/* Hosting module -> $Id: $ */

ABOUT

    This is a dotProject module designed to track ownership of domains and hosting packages.
    It started off as an internal project for Funke Web Solutions to manage expiring domain
    names and hosting packages, so it's simple! The code is fairly messy as there was no official
    API at the time of coding, so I had to look through 5 other modules and use similar code.
    If anyone wants to maintain this project, please let us know.
